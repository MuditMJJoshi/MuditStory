This is Mitch.
Mitch thinks heâ€™s gonna do great this semester. Mitch delays homework until 12:30 am. 
Instead Mitch do Buzz-Feed Quizzes to find out what Avocado Toast he is.
Mitch is smart.
Be like Mitch ;-)

And..
Mitch also thinks he's getting fit. Mitch doesn't eat salad because he thinks they taste icky
INstead, Mitch eats fast food, becuase it's really convenient.
Mitch is smart.
Be like Mitch ;-)
