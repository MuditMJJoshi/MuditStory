This is Mitch.
Mitch thinks heâ€™s gonna do great this semester. Mitch delays homework until 12:30 am. 
Instead Mitch do Buzz-Feed Quizzes to find out what Avocado Toast he is.
Mitch is smart.
Be like Mitch ;-)

And.
Mitch also thinks he's getting fit. Mitch doesn't eat salad because he thinks they taste icky
INstead, Mitch eats fast food, becuase it's really convenient.
Mitch is smart.
Be like Mitch ;-)

Mitch has a friend name Kyle. 
Kyle drinks Mountain Dew with Mitch 
and goes for rides on his snowmobile. He is cool. 
But, not as cool as Mitch who gets fit. 

One day Kyle breaks the snowmobile.
Mitch is angry, as now he has no means of transportation.
The snowmobile allowed him to get around in the heavy snow.
Now Mitch has to get around everywhere by foot.End of my Story-By Mudit, Jenna, Ben, Eric
